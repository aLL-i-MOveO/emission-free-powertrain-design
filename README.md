The powertrain includes every moving component that is critical to the propulsion's success. It s sole objective is transforming kinetic energy into propulsion motion.the powertrain consists of the source of propulsion (e.g. the engine or electric motor) and the drivetrain system which transfers this energy into forward movement of the vehicle.
